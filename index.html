	<p id='instructions' style="display: none;">All players receive a Wikipedia article name, and have 20 seconds to type in as many 
		words as they can think of that appear many times in the article. At the end of the 20
		seconds, each player will receive a score based on how many times these words (and their
		variants) appear in the article. The player with the highest score wins! </p>
