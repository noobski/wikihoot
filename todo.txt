- BUG: if a player quits, the timer stops for the other players
- all formatting in css, not in the ui file

- understanding variants: 
  - add 'es' 'tion' 'i' (like iraq/iraqi) and other suffixes to the part that creates variants
- create option for hebrew
- if 2 players have same name, server crashes

  already write one?)
