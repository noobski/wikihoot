WIKIGUESS TODO:
--------------
- name: should be a mash of 'family feud' with 'kahoot'

TODO:
- scores in the 'players' section
+ change article_list_editor to also check whether all the titles are real wiki articles
- create option for hebrew
- checking player entries: make sure no part of the title is scored
+ showing score: 
  + without stuff in parenthases
  + sorted by score of word
  + show 10 highest words, and who guessed each (incl. nobody)
+ provide 60 seconds for game
+ after pressing start, all players should get feedback ('generating...') until title appears
+ how do i want to deal with space in the input (like "south america")
- when creating the word list, 'star' and 'stars' are considered as different words. should be
  consolidated in to one word (article_generator.js function: create_word_list)
- check that all words in the article_generator word list are real words, and lowercase, etc.  
  check by debugging and looking at the array
- after playing a while, check how much garbage is in the server's user db, by using the route '/rooms'
- beofre the words are sorted (by occurance) in article_generator, they should be consolidated so 
  that 'scent' and 'scents' for example are counted together
- add 'es' 'tion' and other suffixes to the part that creates variants
- size of stuff for mobile
+ back to lobby button instead of start
+ deploy on server
- if 2 players have same name, server crashes
