WIKIGUESS TODO:
--------------
- name: should be a mash of 'family feud' with 'kahoot'

TODO:
- filtering word list after server retrieves the article: (article_generator.js function: create_word_list)
  - they should be consolidated so that 'scent' and 'scents' for example are counted together
  - make sure no part of the title (or its varient) is in the words
  - check that all words in the article_generator word list are real words, and lowercase, etc.  
    check by debugging and looking at the array
- look for all filenames that create a this.article_txt = 'redirect' (or somethign like that) to clean up
- understanding variants: 
  - add 'es' 'tion' 'i' (like iraq/iraqi) and other suffixes to the part that creates variants
- UI Look & Feel
  - nicer colors and layout
  - fit to mobile
- after playing a while, check how much garbage is in the server's user db, by using the route '/rooms'
- create option for hebrew
- if 2 players have same name, server crashes
+ scores in the 'players' section
+ change article_list_editor to also check whether all the titles are real wiki articles
+ showing score: 
  + without stuff in parenthases
  + sorted by score of word
  + show 10 highest words, and who guessed each (incl. nobody)
+ provide 60 seconds for game
+ after pressing start, all players should get feedback ('generating...') until title appears
+ how do i want to deal with space in the input (like "south america")
+ back to lobby button instead of start
+ deploy on server
