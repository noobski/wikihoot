WIKIGUESS TODO:
--------------
- name: should be a mash of 'family feud' with 'kahoot'

TODO:
- change article_list_editor to also check whether all the titles are real wiki articles
- checking player entries: make sure no part of the title is scored
- showing score: 
  - without stuff in parenthases
  - sorted by score of word
  - show highest word in round and which player created them
- provide 60 seconds for game


FEATURES:
- size of stuff for mobile
- back to lobby button instead of start
- deploy on server

BUGS:
- if 2 players have same name, server crashes
- rooms stay in db
